# My work 

In this repository you can see my work done in spare time and aim to make myself a better programmer. Under each link there is a small description of the project.
Projects are done with Javascript, HTML and CSS. 

### To-do list
In this project I implemented a to do list. All data is stored in local storage. You can add and remove projects and also errands on each project. Each errand has their own priority which is show as a color around the date.

### Marketplace

### Tic-tac-toe
A simple inplementation of a user against user tic-tac-toe game. The whole code is stored in a single module, so there is just a small portion of global code.

### Web library
With this project I wanted to make a personal web library, which it would let you store all books that you find interesting. For now it doesn't support local storage, which could be a future improvement. Each book is represented as an object with the most imporatant attributes. The style is done with Bootstrap.

Thank you for checking my work! In future I want to improve exsisting projects as well as add new ones.
